# Editor

Tolaria offers a rich editor for daily writing and a raw Markdown mode for exact file control. Both modes write back to the same Markdown file.

## Rich Editing

The rich editor supports blocks, slash commands, wikilinks, tables, code blocks, editable callouts, images, Mermaid diagrams, LaTeX-style math, and markdown-backed whiteboards.

Use it when you want to write and reorganize quickly without thinking about Markdown syntax.

Headings and list items can collapse long sections without changing the Markdown file. Block selection lets you move, copy, cut, paste, or delete whole blocks—including the hidden content inside a collapsed section.

See [Use The Rich Editor](/guides/use-rich-editor) for date and time commands, block selection, collapsible sections, callouts, code blocks, highlights, and their shortcuts.

## HTML Source

Fenced `html` blocks remain ordinary source-code blocks. They do not render, execute, or resolve vault expressions, and they remain editable in the rich editor. Standalone `.html` files use the generic unsupported-file fallback. See [HTML Code Blocks](/guides/use-html-blocks).

## Raw Mode

Raw mode shows the Markdown source directly. Use it when you need to edit YAML frontmatter, repair unusual Markdown, or make an exact text change.

Toggle raw mode with `Cmd+\` on macOS or `Ctrl+\` on Windows and Linux.

Tolaria highlights invalid YAML frontmatter in raw mode so malformed metadata is easier to locate and repair.

## Table Of Contents

The table of contents panel builds an outline from headings in the current note. It is useful for long notes, procedures, research files, and generated documents. Toggle it with `Cmd+Shift+T` on macOS or `Ctrl+Shift+T` on Windows and Linux.

## Width

Notes can use normal or wide editor width. Set the default in Settings, or override an individual note from the editor toolbar.
